# RockPaperScissors
A simple python Rock Paper Scissors game. Includes both multiplayer and single player modes.
Please feel free to edit and change this code as you please to improve it!
Please let me know of any bugs and I will try and fix ASAP.
I wrote this over about 20 hours in pycharm. I am a beginner in python, so its a very simple game. I hope you enjoy!!
This is my project as part of my EDT bronze industrial cadets.
